# Test Lab

Today we'll be practicing how to install a package and make a data visualization.

## Install and load 'tidyverse' and 'nycflights13' packages

Run this code below:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

Now make one graph of anything you want from the 'nycflights13' dataset in the code chunk below:

```{r}
# your code here
```
